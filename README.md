Portfolio Site
==============

This is my portfolio site using HTML/CSS and Javascript.

I plan to make the pages dynamic with transitions for text and on hover.
I am also planning on embedding a processing sketch into the background.

- The front page has a nav bar at the top, with my bio, recent projects, and social media links below it. 
- The portfolio page contains all of my projects that are on the site. 
- The contact page has my information with a downloadable resume.
