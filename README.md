Portfolio Site
==============

Hello! 
This is my first portfolio site using HTML/CSS and Javascript.
I say first, because I'm sure I will be creating another soon enough. 
     
Lessons learned:  
- Start design with small screens in mind, and then build from there. 
- Declare text and color variables first in CSS, because I will want to change them.  
- If there's a bug: check your spelling first, parent/child containers second, and google third.
- Links might work fine locally...the final product is not local.
- Comment, comment, comment. Just because you wrote something does not mean you'll remember it.

Overall, I'm excited to be finished with the site - it means that I can start working on other projects to add to it. Eventually I'll have enough to build a whole new site with a separate page just for projects!
