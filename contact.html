        <h2>Hello, my name is Jessica B.</h2>
        <p>I&#39;m a freelance frontend developer living 
          in Rock Island, Illinois. I have an Associate&#39;s Degree from the Delaware College 
          of Art and Design where I built a foundation in design and animation. From there I 
          went to Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, New York and majored in Interactive Arts. I loved 
          working with Processing, Arduino, and web design, but I ultimately decided that 
          New York City, and the cost of living there, was not for me. I came home to the 
          Quad Cities and finished my Bachelor&#39;s Degree at St. Ambrose University. While 
          working full-time, I decided to start coding again and spent many early mornings and 
          late nights to earn certificates through Codecademy.</p>   

        <p>My personal goal is to further build my knowledge in frontend development, and 
          begin learning some backend languages in order to understand how the two fit together. 
          I love learning and the idea that there will always be something new to pick up in the 
          tech field is so exciting to me. I find writing code and watching it work to be so 
          rewarding - even more so after squashing bugs.</p>
          
        <p>On top of HTML5/CSS, JavaScript, Git, Processing, and Arduino - I can work in Adobe 
          Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, Premiere Pro, After Effects, and Dreamweaver. My soft 
          skills include time management, critical thinking, troubleshooting, and creative problem 
          solving.</p>  
          
        <p>Outside of developing, my hobbies include: paper-crafting, embroidery, record collecting, 
          learning Mandarin, reading classic literature, being alone in the woods, riding my bike 
          along the Mississippi, and playing Lord of the Rings Online.</p>
